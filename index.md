## About Me

I am a Master’s in Computer Science student at Tufts University in Medford, MA. Prior to my arrival at Tufts, I worked as an office manager and assistant at a literary agency in Brooklyn, NY. I earned a B.S. in Biology from The University of Alabama in 2016, where I wrote my honors senior thesis on the use of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to detect endocrine-disrupting compounds in mangrove rivulus (*Kryptolebias marmoratus*) tissues.
 
While at Tufts, I’ve been active in computational biology research: I’ve contributed to the development of a disease gene prioritization algorithm, ADAGIO (see [GitHub](https://github.com/merterden98/ADAGIO); paper to be published in the [ACM-BCB 2022](https://acm-bcb.org/) Conference Proceedings) and am currently working on a project analyzing DNA repair, which is the subject of my DREAM research this summer.
 
In my spare time, I bake, hike, and draw. I plan to graduate with my M.S. in Computer Science in May 2023.


## About My Advisor

[Lenore Cowen](http://www.cs.tufts.edu/~cowen/) is a professor of Computer Science at Tufts University. She holds a B.A. in Mathematics from Yale and a Ph.D. in Mathematics from MIT. Her research areas include applications of graphs, networks, and algorithms in computational biology, and span from PPI prediction to coral reef genetics and ecology. 

## About My Project

DNA double-stranded breaks (DSBs) are very common and caused by a multitude of events, from chemotherapy treatments to errors in DNA replication. Improper repair can be detrimental to the cell and, in some cases, to human health<sup>1</sup>. Repair of these breaks occurs through a variety of mechanisms that depend on the phase of the cell cycle, presence of helper molecules, and characteristics of the sequence undergoing repair. In some of these mechanisms, a single-stranded template is available, usually from a sister chromatid, and repair results are highly accurate. In others, a diverse set of often poorly-understood and error-prone processes can occur<sup>2</sup>. 

The [McVey Lab](https://ase.tufts.edu/biology/labs/mcvey/) is interested in characterizing DSB repair both broadly and in the context of a specific error-prone pathway known as synthesis-dependent microhomology-mediated end-joining (SD-MMEJ). They have generated a dataset of ~1,100 partly-randomized DNA constructs subject to Cas9-induced double-stranded breaks and subsequently repaired and sequenced. The goal of my research this summer is to explore this dataset to see  whether we can use sequence characteristics to characterize patterns in erroneous repair. A broad overview of the project splits this problem into two parts:

1.	Cluster constructs into bins based on sequence characteristics
2.	Examine whether constructs within the same bin share similar “repair events” or mutations that occur during repair

I will explore and analyze the results of various approaches to these two aims.
