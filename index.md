## About Me

I am a Master’s in Computer Science candidate at Tufts University in Medford, MA. Prior to my arrival at Tufts, I spent three years working at a literary agency in Brooklyn, NY. I earned a B.S. in Biology from The University of Alabama in 2016, where I wrote my honors senior thesis on the use of liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) to detect endocrine-disrupting compounds in mangrove rivulus (Kryptolebias marmoratus) tissues.
 
While at Tufts, I’ve been active in computational biology research: I’ve contributed to the development of a disease gene prioritization algorithm and am currently working on a project analyzing DNA repair. I am expanding on the DNA repair analysis for the DREAM program this summer.
 
In my spare time, I bake, hike, and draw. I plan to graduate with my M.S. in Computer Science in May 2023.
